# Resources

This is a collection of resources I found interesting, useful, and/or worth saving for later reference. These resources are organized in markdown files, which are fetched from a FastAPI backend and rendered using TypeScript.

The directory structure in the backend project is reproduced in the frontend sidebar, using recursive functions that create and parse tree JSON objects.
