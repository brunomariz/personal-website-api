## IP resources management

## Hierarchy

All of the world's IP resources are managed by a hierarchy of global and regional organizations. 
The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/) is the top level organization that allocates 
resources to [Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)](#regional-internet-registries-rirs), which in turn follow their regional rules 
to allocate those resources to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). 

## Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)

### RIPE NCC

RIPE NCC is the Regional Internet Registry for Europe, Middle East and Central Asia.

> We register IP addresses and ASNs, and act as the secretariat to the RIPE community. (https://www.ripe.net/)

RIPE's stance on this issue is to maintain the internet's integrity, even if they feel personally inclined to 
use their power as leverage against Russia (https://labs.ripe.net/author/hans_petter_holen/an-open-internet-remains-the-goal/).
