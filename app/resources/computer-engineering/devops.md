# Dev Ops

DevOps is a collaborative approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to enhance the efficiency, speed, and quality of software development and delivery. It emphasizes communication, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility. By breaking down silos between development and operations, DevOps aims to streamline the software development lifecycle, allowing for faster iterations, quicker response to changes, and increased overall agility in delivering software solutions.
